# Getting Started

CleanGraph can be set up on both Windows and Linux systems. The following instructions will guide you through the setup process on both operating systems.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine running Python 3.8+ and Node.js 16.15.\* (ensures the frontend can proxy to the backend, issues occur with later versions of Node).
- You have basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript, and command-line tools.

## Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

First, clone the CleanGraph repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nlp-tlp/CleanGraph
```


## Alternative step 2: use docker and docker-compose to spin up the project

First, you will need to have `docker` and `docker-compose`
Then you can run the following command to spin up the project

```bash
docker-compose -f scripts/compose/docker-compose.yml up
```
It will take a while for the first time to spin up the project, but after that, it will be much faster.
The reason is that the docker image will be cached locally, also the `npm install` will take a while to install all the dependencies.

If you get this step done successfully, you can skip the rest of the steps to spin up the project.

## Step 2: Setup the Client

Navigate into the `client/` directory. Install the client dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Setup the Server

Navigate to the `server/` directory. Here, set up a Python virtual environment and install the server dependencies.

**For Windows:**

Create a virtual environment called `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

**For Linux:**

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file with the following structure - this is used to connect to the MongoDB database:

> If you are not familiar with MongoDB - visit [here](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database) to create a new database.

```bash
PORT=8000

MONGO_DB_USERNAME="<YOUR_MONGO_DB_USERNAME>"
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD="<YOUR_MONGO_DB_PASSWORD>"
MONGO_CLUSTER_NAME="<YOUR_MONGO_DB_CLUSTER_NAME>"
MONGO_DB_NAME="<YOUR_MONGO_DB_NAME>"
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://${MONGO_DB_USERNAME}:${MONGO_DB_PASSWORD}@${MONGO_CLUSTER_NAME}.0aum8fo.mongodb.net/${MONGO_DB_NAME}?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

## Step 4: Run CleanGraph

Once the setup is complete, start the client and server separately.

To start the client, navigate to the `client/` directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the client on `http://localhost:3000`

To start the server, make sure the virtual environment is activated, navigate to the `server/` directory, and run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`

After completing these steps, you should now have CleanGraph up and running on your machine.

## Step 5: Optional - Setup the Documentation Site

If you wish to have the documentation site available locally, you can set it up by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the `docs/` directory in your terminal.
2. Set up a new Python virtual environment.

**For Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv

```

**For Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the newly created virtual environment.

**For Windows:**

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For Linux:**

```bash
source venv\bin\activate
```

4. Install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the documentation site server using MkDocs.

```bash
mkdocs server -a 0.0.0.0:8001
```

Upon completion of these steps, the documentation site should be available at `http://localhost:8001`. You can navigate the documentation through your web browser while the MkDocs server is running.
